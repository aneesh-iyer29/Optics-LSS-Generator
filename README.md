# Optics-LSS-Generator
Laser Shoot Setup generator using Python and Matplotlib. Will generate setups according to the rules for the 2024-2025 season and includes the gridlines and a target point (in cm).

To use the code:
1. Download the source file (lasershoot.py) and run it using any platform of your choosing
2. That's it! A new, random, LSS setup will appear. Feel free to run the script multiple times until you find one that is satisfactory, and have fun!
